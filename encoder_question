Hi TickPi, I have a question for you. I'm taking an MIT Open Courseware, Intro to (Computer Science and Electrical Engineering)[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/] class. 

In that class, they use the Pioneer Robot Platform with Soar simulation software to allow the students to program the robot in python. Goal is / by the end of the class you're racing your autonomous robot. 

The Pioneer is no longer available and I'm looking for a replacement. The Jetbot seems like a nice option but I need to add ultrasonic sensor for distance readings and an encoder for position readings. 

Your picture shows you've accomplished the encoder piece. Question: What parts did you have to buy? Is there anything else I'll need to consider when building?

I've found this (website)[https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/my-jetbot/73068] where they recommend the Wheel Encoder Kit and Gearmotor from SparkFun. 

Thank you!
